You can also check out this page for a full list of our guidelines.\\n\\n\\nYouTube doesn’t allow anything that artificially increases the number of views, likes, comments, or other metrics either by using automatic systems or serving up videos to unsuspecting viewers. Also, content that solely exists to incentivize viewers for engagement (views, likes, comments, etc) is prohibited.\\nContent and channels\\xa0that don't follow this policy may be terminated and removed from YouTube.\\nImportant:\\xa0\\xa0If you hire someone to promote your channel, their decisions may impact your channel. Any method that violates our policies may\\xa0result in content removal or a channel takedown, whether it's an action taken by you or someone you've hired.\\nWe consider engagement to be legitimate when a human user’s primary intent is to authentically interact with the content. We consider engagement illegitimate, for example, when it results from coercion or deception, or when the sole purpose of the engagement is financial gain.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you find content that violates this policy, report it. Instructions for reporting violations of our Community Guidelines are available here.\\xa0If you've found a few\\xa0videos or comments that you would like to report, you can report the channel.\\n\\nWhat this policy means for you\\nIf you're posting content\\nDon’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.\\n\\nLinks to or promotes third-party services that artificially inflate metrics like views, likes, and subscribers\\nContent linking to or promoting third-party view count or subscriber gaming websites or services\\nOffering to subscribe to another creator’s channel only if they subscribe to your channel (“sub4sub”)\\n    \\nNote: You're allowed to encourage viewers to\\xa0subscribe, hit the like button, share, or leave a comment\\n\\n\\nContent featuring a creator purchasing their views from a third party with the intent of promoting the service\\n\\nThis policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.

The number in YouTube Analytics is approximately 48 hours behind. The delay lets us perform extra verification and spam reviews so the numbers are\\xa0accurate.\\nPage traffic found to be artificial will not be counted on YouTube and can lead to strikes on your account. Terminated accounts and subscribers that are identified as spam will not count toward your total number of subscribers or views. These aren't\\xa0active viewers, so their removal shouldn’t impact your views or watch time.\\nIf you've had a video removed for view count gaming, check out this page in the Help Center to learn more.\\n\\n\\nExamples\\nHere are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.\\n\\nA video testimonial in which a creator shows themselves successfully purchasing artificial page traffic from a third party\\nA video in which a creator links to a third party artificial page traffic provider in a promotional or supportive context. For example: “I got 1 million subscribers on this video in a day and you can too!”\\nA video that tries to force or trick viewers into watching another video through deceptive means (for example: a misleadingly labeled info card)\\nChannels dedicated to artificial channel engagement traffic or promoting businesses that exist for this sole purpose\\n\\nRemember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.\\nWhat happens if content violates this policy\\nIf your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.\\nIf this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued.

Generally, we do not remove dramatized violence when the content or metadata lets us know that the content is fictional, or when it’s apparent from the content itself, such as animated content or video games.\\nWe consider the following when deciding whether to allow, age-restrict or remove content. Note that this isn’t a complete list:\\n\\nWhether violent or gory imagery is the focus of the video.

Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context. In these cases, the content gets an EDSA exception. This article has tips for how you can add context—more information that informs or educates viewers—to your EDSA content.\\n\\nNote: Adding context to your EDSA content doesn’t guarantee that it will get an EDSA exception.\\n\\nHow content gets an EDSA exception\\nWe assess whether content gets an EDSA exception on a case-by-case basis. First, we check if there’s a Community Guidelines violation in the content. If there’s a violation, we review if there’s enough context in the content to make an EDSA exception. We review WHAT context is present and WHERE the context is.\\nWhat context to add to your EDSA content\\nThe type of context you must include to get an EDSA exception depends on what’s in the content.\\nWe make most EDSA exceptions when content has one or more of the following:\\n1. Basic facts about what’s happening in the content: Identify who’s in the content, describe what the content shows or when and where it takes place, or explain why certain content is present.\\n\\nExamples of basic facts\\n\\n\\nBasic facts are especially helpful when content is violent or graphic or shows nudity or sex. This content may be less harmful to viewers when there’s context.\\nThese examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\nLess likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurity footage that shows victims of a violent robbery getting injured with details in the video. Details may include where and when the crime took place, how it happened, and why the video is posted.\\n\\n\\nSecurity footage that shows victims of a violent robbery getting injured with emoji, like 😆 or 😲, superimposed on the imagery or in the video title.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurgery footage that shows open wounds with details in the video. Details may include what type of surgery is taking place and why.\\n\\n\\nSurgery footage that shows open wounds with a title or description that says it will “gross out” or “shock” the viewer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrief nudity that’s part of a theatrical performance, in which the nudity is shown in the context of a longer storyline.\\n\\n\\nClips of nudity pulled from various documentaries with vulgar text overlaid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFootage of violence in which people are seen with fatal injuries that includes production credits letting viewers know the violence is part of a dramatic performance.\\n\\n\\nFootage of violence in which people are seen with fatal injuries where an average viewer wouldn’t be able to tell if the violence is real or part of a dramatic performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Condemnation, opposing views, or satire: Communicate that your content condemns certain claims, includes opposing points of view, or is satirical.\\n\\nExamples of condemnation, opposing views, or satire\\n\\n\\nSome content can be misleading on its own, but it may be less harmful to viewers when there’s context. Context can include criticizing a hateful ideology, or discrediting false claims by highlighting views from authoritative sources.\\nThese examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\nLess likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual makes a false claim that individuals who are older than a certain age aren’t allowed to vote in a democratic election. The content also clarifies that the claim is false.\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual makes a false claim that individuals who are older than a certain age aren’t allowed to vote in a democratic election without more context.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual makes a false claim that vaccines contain microchips, and a critic of that individual states that the claim is false.\\nContent where an individual claims that approved vaccines contain microchips without more context.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent that quotes an individual who calls for violence against a group based on their race. The content criticizes and condemns the individual’s actions.\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual calls for violence against a group based on their race without more context, or with a title or description promoting violence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Discouragement of dangerous behavior: Tell viewers not to imitate what’s in the video.\\n\\nExamples of discouraging dangerous behavior\\n\\n\\nDiscouraging imitation helps reduce the risk of harm to viewers and the YouTube community. This is especially helpful when content shows activities that are harmful or dangerous or when content is related to self-harm. Remember that this is not a free pass to promote or celebrate dangerous behavior. Simply saying, “Don’t try this at home” may not result in an exception if it’s not accompanied by an explanation of potential harm.\\nThese examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\nLess likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a home invasion prank, and the content tells the viewer not to imitate the dangerous activity because it could result in physical or emotional harm.\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a home invasion prank or a reaction video to a home invasion prank. Laughing or reacting to a dangerous activity may not be enough to reduce the potential harm of a viewer imitating it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a dangerous road stunt that could injure bystanders. The content tells the viewer not to imitate the stunt because of the serious harm it could cause or recommends professional supervision.\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a dangerous road stunt that could injure bystanders without more context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: The above examples aren't a complete list of the context that you can add to your EDSA content. When in doubt, add multiple forms of context to your EDSA content. To help prevent content from causing harm, include the info in your video, not just your video’s title or description.\\n\\n\\nWhen in doubt, include different types of context described above: basic factual information that explains what’s in your content, multiple points of view, and clear and informative discouragement against imitating dangerous or harmful behavior. Be sure to include this information in the content itself, like the video or audio, to help avoid the content potentially causing harm.\\nIn some cases, we may make EDSA exceptions to allow certain content based on public interest. This could include, for example, content like national political candidates on the campaign trail, graphic footage from active warzones or humanitarian crises, or comments disputing health authority guidance made during a public hearing. We may apply an age restriction or warning to content even if it gets an EDSA exception because it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 (e.g. violent crime footage in a documentary).\\nWHERE to add context to your EDSA content\\nYou can add context to your:\\n\\nVideo\\n    \\nFor example, you can add footage or text overlays.\\n\\n\\nAudio\\n    \\nFor example, you can add narration including condemnation or a countervailing point of view.\\n\\n\\nVideo title\\nVideo description\\n\\n\\nNote: We may not make EDSA exceptions for context that may be in comments, tags, channel descriptions, pinned comments, or other surfaces. That content isn’t always visible to viewers.\\n\\n\\nImportant: For content that risks the most harm, we require context in the VIDEO or AUDIO. The video and audio are the parts of the content where viewers will most likely get the context, including when the content is embedded on other websites or apps. Content where we require context in the audio or video to give an EDSA exception includes content related to hate speech, violent criminal organizations, child safety, suicide and self-harm, and graphic violence.\\n\\nWhat about other types of content, like comments?\\nThe same policies and guidelines that apply to videos also apply to other types of content.\\nContent that may not get EDSA exceptions\\nCertain content may not be allowed on YouTube, even if it has context added.\\n\\nChild Sexual Abuse Media (CSAM)\\nVideo, still imagery, or audio of violent physical sexual assaults\\nThe act of decapitation\\nFootage filmed by the perpetrator of a deadly or major violent event that shows weapons, violence, or injured victims\\nUnmodified reuploads of content created by or glorifying violent terrorist or criminal organizations\\nInstructions on how to self-harm or die by suicide\\nInstructions on how to build a bomb that’s meant to injure or kill others\\nInstructions on how to manufacture a firearm or prohibited accessories\\nOffers of prohibited sales\\nInstructions on how to use computers or information technology to compromise personal data or cause serious harm to others\\nContent that reveals an individual’s private information, such as their home address, email addresses, sign-in credentials, phone numbers, passport number, or bank account information (doxxing)\\nHardcore pornography\\nSpam\\n\\n   Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit   \"),\n",

Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate our Community Guidelines may stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context. In these cases, the content gets an EDSA exception. This article has tips for how you can add context—more information that informs or educates viewers—to your EDSA content.\\n\\nNote: Adding context to your EDSA content doesn’t guarantee that it will get an EDSA exception.\\n\\nHow content gets an EDSA exception\\nWe assess whether content gets an EDSA exception on a case-by-case basis. First, we check if there’s a Community Guidelines violation in the content. If there’s a violation, we review if there’s enough context in the content to make an EDSA exception. We review WHAT context is present and WHERE the context is.\\nWhat context to add to your EDSA content\\nThe type of context you must include to get an EDSA exception depends on what’s in the content.\\nWe make most EDSA exceptions when content has one or more of the following:\\n1. Basic facts about what’s happening in the content: Identify who’s in the content, describe what the content shows or when and where it takes place, or explain why certain content is present.\\n\\nExamples of basic facts\\n\\n\\nBasic facts are especially helpful when content is violent or graphic or shows nudity or sex. This content may be less harmful to viewers when there’s context.\\nThese examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\nLess likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurity footage that shows victims of a violent robbery getting injured with details in the video. Details may include where and when the crime took place, how it happened, and why the video is posted.\\n\\n\\nSecurity footage that shows victims of a violent robbery getting injured with emoji, like 😆 or 😲, superimposed on the imagery or in the video title.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurgery footage that shows open wounds with details in the video. Details may include what type of surgery is taking place and why.\\n\\n\\nSurgery footage that shows open wounds with a title or description that says it will “gross out” or “shock” the viewer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrief nudity that’s part of a theatrical performance, in which the nudity is shown in the context of a longer storyline.\\n\\n\\nClips of nudity pulled from various documentaries with vulgar text overlaid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFootage of violence in which people are seen with fatal injuries that includes production credits letting viewers know the violence is part of a dramatic performance.\\n\\n\\nFootage of violence in which people are seen with fatal injuries where an average viewer wouldn’t be able to tell if the violence is real or part of a dramatic performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2. Condemnation, opposing views, or satire: Communicate that your content condemns certain claims, includes opposing points of view, or is satirical.\\n\\nExamples of condemnation, opposing views, or satire\\n\\n\\nSome content can be misleading on its own, but it may be less harmful to viewers when there’s context. Context can include criticizing a hateful ideology, or discrediting false claims by highlighting views from authoritative sources.\\nThese examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\nLess likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual makes a false claim that individuals who are older than a certain age aren’t allowed to vote in a democratic election. The content also clarifies that the claim is false.\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual makes a false claim that individuals who are older than a certain age aren’t allowed to vote in a democratic election without more context.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual makes a false claim that vaccines contain microchips, and a critic of that individual states that the claim is false.\\nContent where an individual claims that approved vaccines contain microchips without more context.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent that quotes an individual who calls for violence against a group based on their race. The content criticizes and condemns the individual’s actions.\\n\\n\\nContent where an individual calls for violence against a group based on their race without more context, or with a title or description promoting violence.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3. Discouragement of dangerous behavior: Tell viewers not to imitate what’s in the video.\\n\\nExamples of discouraging dangerous behavior\\n\\n\\nDiscouraging imitation helps reduce the risk of harm to viewers and the YouTube community. This is especially helpful when content shows activities that are harmful or dangerous or when content is related to self-harm. Remember that this is not a free pass to promote or celebrate dangerous behavior. Simply saying, “Don’t try this at home” may not result in an exception if it’s not accompanied by an explanation of potential harm.\\nThese examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\nLess likely to get an EDSA exception\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a home invasion prank, and the content tells the viewer not to imitate the dangerous activity because it could result in physical or emotional harm.\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a home invasion prank or a reaction video to a home invasion prank. Laughing or reacting to a dangerous activity may not be enough to reduce the potential harm of a viewer imitating it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a dangerous road stunt that could injure bystanders. The content tells the viewer not to imitate the stunt because of the serious harm it could cause or recommends professional supervision.\\n\\n\\nContent that shows a dangerous road stunt that could injure bystanders without more context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNote: The above examples aren't a complete list of the context that you can add to your EDSA content. When in doubt, add multiple forms of context to your EDSA content. To help prevent content from causing harm, include the info in your video, not just your video’s title or description.\\n\\n\\nWhen in doubt, include different types of context described above: basic factual information that explains what’s in your content, multiple points of view, and clear and informative discouragement against imitating dangerous or harmful behavior. Be sure to include this information in the content itself, like the video or audio, to help avoid the content potentially causing harm.\\nIn some cases, we may make EDSA exceptions to allow certain content based on public interest. This could include, for example, content like national political candidates on the campaign trail, graphic footage from active warzones or humanitarian crises, or comments disputing health authority guidance made during a public hearing. We may apply an age restriction or warning to content even if it gets an EDSA exception because it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 (e.g. violent crime footage in a documentary).\\nWHERE to add context to your EDSA content\\nYou can add context to your:\\n\\nVideo\\n    \\nFor example, you can add footage or text overlays.\\n\\n\\nAudio\\n    \\nFor example, you can add narration including condemnation or a countervailing point of view.\\n\\n\\nVideo title\\nVideo description\\n\\n\\nNote: We may not make EDSA exceptions for context that may be in comments, tags, channel descriptions, pinned comments, or other surfaces. That content isn’t always visible to viewers.\\n\\n\\nImportant: For content that risks the most harm, we require context in the VIDEO or AUDIO. The video and audio are the parts of the content where viewers will most likely get the context, including when the content is embedded on other websites or apps. Content where we require context in the audio or video to give an EDSA exception includes content related to hate speech, violent criminal organizations, child safety, suicide and self-harm, and graphic violence.\\n\\nWhat about other types of content, like comments?\\nThe same policies and guidelines that apply to videos also apply to other types of content.\\nContent that may not get EDSA exceptions\\nCertain content may not be allowed on YouTube, even if it has context added.\\n\\nChild Sexual Abuse Media (CSAM)\\nVideo, still imagery, or audio of violent physical sexual assaults\\nThe act of decapitation\\nFootage filmed by the perpetrator of a deadly or major violent event that shows weapons, violence, or injured victims\\nUnmodified reuploads of content created by or glorifying violent terrorist or criminal organizations\\nInstructions on how to self-harm or die by suicide\\nInstructions on how to build a bomb that’s meant to injure or kill others\\nInstructions on how to manufacture a firearm or prohibited accessories\\nOffers of prohibited sales\\nInstructions on how to use computers or information technology to compromise personal data or cause serious harm to others\\nContent that reveals an individual’s private information, such as their home address, email addresses, sign-in credentials, phone numbers, passport number, or bank account information (doxxing)\\nHardcore pornography\\nSpam\\n\\n   Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit   \"),\n",

To find info about copyright strikes, which are different from Community Guidelines strikes, go to our copyright strike basics.\\nCommunity Guidelines are the rules of the road for how to behave on YouTube. These policies apply to all types of content on our platform, including unlisted and private content, comments, links, posts, and thumbnails. This list isn’t complete. If your content violates our Community Guidelines, your channel may get a strike.\\nNote: We may remove content for reasons other than Community Guidelines violations. For example, a first-party privacy complaint or a court order. In these cases, your channel won't get a strike.\\nCreating with Common Sense: YouTube Community Guidelines\\nWhat happens when you get a strike\\nWhen you get a strike, you're told via email. You can also choose to have notifications sent to you through your mobile and computer notifications, and in your channel settings. We’ll also tell you:\\n\\nWhat content was removed\\nWhich policies it violated (for example harassment or violence)\\nHow it affects your channel\\nWhat you can do next\\n\\nIf your content violates our Community Guidelines, here’s how it affects your channel:\\nWarning\\nWe understand mistakes happen and you don’t mean to violate our policies — that’s why the first violation is typically only a warning. To have this warning expire after 90 days, you can take an optional\\xa0policy training. However, if your content violates the same policy within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike.\\nSometimes a single case of severe abuse will result in channel termination without warning. If you think we made a mistake, you can submit an appeal.\\nOptional policy trainings\\nPolicy trainings are short in-product educational experiences based on the specific Community Guidelines policy you’ve violated.\\nIf you receive a Community Guidelines warning, you can access the policy training from your Studio account anywhere you typically check your policy violations. This includes the Studio dashboard and the Content tab. You’ll also see a link to open the training from the email and banner notifications. Note: Not all Community Guidelines warnings are eligible for policy trainings.\\nIf you complete an optional policy training, your warning will expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.\\nRepeated violations of our policies– or a single case of severe abuse– may still result in the termination of your account. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking trainings in the future.\\nFirst Strike\\nIf we find your content doesn’t follow our policies for a second time, you'll get a strike.\\nThis strike means you will not be allowed to do the following for 1 week:\\n\\nUpload videos or live streams\\nStart a scheduled live stream\\nSchedule a video to become public\\nCreate a Premiere\\nAdd a trailer to an upcoming Premiere or live stream\\nCreate custom thumbnails or posts\\nCreate, edit, or add collaborators to playlists\\nAdd or remove playlists from the watch page using the “Save” button\\n\\nYour scheduled public content is set to “private” for the penalty period duration. You have to reschedule it when the freeze period ends.\\nNote: Penalty starts from the date of acknowledgement.\\nAfter the 1-week period, we restore full privileges automatically, but the strike remains on your channel for 90 days.\\nA strike may also result in losing access to advanced features. Learn more about how to regain access.\\nSecond Strike\\nIf you get a second strike within the same 90-day period as your first strike, you will not be allowed to post content for 2 weeks. If there are no further issues, after the 2-week period, we restore full privileges automatically. Each strike will not expire until 90 days from the time it was issued.\\nThird Strike\\n3 strikes in the same 90-day period may result in your channel being permanently removed from YouTube. Each strike will not expire until 90 days from the time it was issued.\\nNote: Deleting your content doesn't remove a strike. We may also issue a Community Guidelines strike on deleted content. You can learn more about when we retain deleted content in our Privacy policy.\\nIf your Official Artist Channel gets a Community Guidelines strike, the channel\\xa0will be suspended and become a standard channel. Learn more.\\n\\n\\n\\nGet tips about community guidelines.\\n\\n\\nWhat to do when you get a strike\\nWe want to help you stay on YouTube, so remember to do the following:\\n\\nLearn about our Community Guidelines to make sure your content follows our policies.\\nIf your channel got a strike, and you think we've made a mistake, let us know. You can appeal the decision here.\\n\\nYouTube also reserves the right to restrict a creator's ability to create content at its discretion. Your channel may be turned off or restricted from using any YouTube features.\\nIf this happens, you're prohibited from using, creating, or acquiring another channel to get around these restrictions. This prohibition applies as long as the restriction remains active on your YouTube channel. Violation of this restriction is considered circumvention under our Terms of Service, and may result in termination of all your existing YouTube channels, any new channels that you create or acquire, and channels in which you are repeatedly or prominently featured.\\n   Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit   \"),\n",
